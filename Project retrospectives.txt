Project Retrospective: Personal Portfolio Website
Overview
This document summarizes the development journey of building a modern, responsive personal portfolio website using Vite + React. It details the work accomplished, technical challenges encountered during the process, and the specific solutions implemented to overcome them.

Work Accomplished
Project Initialization: Scaffolding a new React application using Vite for a fast and lightweight development experience.
Design System Implementation: Created a custom design system (
index.css
) with:
Dark mode centric color palette (Slate/Indigo/Pink).
Modern typography using Google Fonts (Outfit & Inter).
Glassmorphism utility classes for a premium UI feel.
Component Development:
Navbar: Responsive, sticky navigation with blur effects.
Hero: Dynamic introduction with floating animations and profile image integration.
About: Skills grid and professional summary.
Projects: Scalable component displaying 16+ detailed project cards with hover effects.
Contact: Functional-looking form and social media integration.
Deployment & Domain: Configured Netlify for continuous deployment and successfully mapped a custom domain (gadi.info).
Challenges & Solutions
1. Environment Configuration
Challenge: The local environment initially lacked Node.js/npm and Git/Xcode Developer Tools, preventing the project from starting. Solution:

Identified the missing binaries via terminal checks.
Paused execution to guide the user through the installation of Node.js and Xcode CLI tools (xcode-select --install).
Verified installation before proceeding with the build.
2. Version Control Authentication
Challenge: Pushing code to GitHub required authentication. The automated agent environment cannot handle interactive prompts (username/password inputs) securely. Solution:

Initialized the local repository and configured the remote origin programmatically.
Instructed the user to execute the final git push command manually in their terminal to handle the secure authentication handshake.
3. Deployment Tooling
Challenge: The netlify-cli was not installed on the system, which initially blocked the plan for a CLI-based deployment. Solution:

Pivoted to a Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow.
Created a 
netlify.toml
 configuration file to define build settings (npm run build) and redirects.
Guided the user to connect their GitHub repository directly to Netlify's UI, ensuring automatic updates on every future push.
4. Custom Domain & DNS Propagation
Challenge: After configuring the custom domain (gadi.info), the user encountered "Under Construction" pages (Squarespace default) and SSL protocol errors. Solution:

Diagnosis: Identified that the errors were due to DNS propagation delays and browser caching (the domain was correctly pointing to Netlify, verified via dig and curl diagnostics).
Fix: Advised the user to wait for propagation and test on a separate network (mobile data) to bypass local cache, which confirmed the site was live and secure.
Future Recommendations
Form Backend: Currently, the contact form is frontend-only. Recommend integrating EmailJS or Formspree to receive actual emails without a backend server.
SEO Optimization: Add unique meta descriptions and Open Graph tags for each section to improve visibility on social media.
Image Optimization: Convert project images to WebP format for faster load times.
